Yet   another   clone     of    the  Antigrain     Geometry    library
(http://www.antigrain.com/)    created  by  Maxim     Shemanarev.  The
hi-quality  graphics library without  any central maintainer (?). This
clone is based on https://agg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agg.

It is meant to serve as the  backend for my  poppler-agg project to be
found under:

 https://github.com/oncaphillis/poppler-agg.git

Changes for now

 * made some operators for **agg::trans_affine** const

 * added  **agg_color_cmyka**  and  **agg_pixfmt_cmyk** Everything  we
   need to paint in CMYK colorspace.

 * added  **add::gradient_biradial** a  plugin  class for the gradient
   calculation which supports the radial gradient filling as specified
   for PDF/Postscript

 * removed     global  constant **gradient_subpixel_shift**  and allow
   GradientF    template    argument   to    "inherit"  its   personal
   subpixel_shift value. This way it is possible to generate gradients
   of variable "smoothness".
