Yet   another   clone     of    the  Antigrain     Geometry    library
(http://www.antigrain.com/)    created  by  Maxim     Shemanarev.  The
hi-quality  graphics library without  any central maintainer (?). This
clone is based on https://agg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agg.

It is meant to serve as the  backend for my  poppler-agg project to be
found under:

 https://github.com/oncaphillis/poppler-agg.git

Changes for now

 * made some operators for   agg::trans_affine   const

 * added    agg_color_cmyka    and    agg_pixfmt_cmyk   Everything  we
   need to paint in CMYK colorspace.

 * added    add::gradient_biradial   a  plugin  class for the gradient
   calculation which supports the radial gradient filling as specified
   for PDF/Postscript

 * removed     global  constant   gradient_subpixel_shift    and allow
   GradientF    template    argument   to    "inherit"  its   personal
   subpixel_shift value. This way it is possible to generate gradients
   of variable "smoothness".

 * new  color type and  agg::pixfmt_device_n<N> agg_color_device_na<N> 
   for   color  spaces with  variable  numbers  of color channels like 
   DeviceN in pdf.
